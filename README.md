# AttaCard-Generator
A generator for a possible future card game or two.

# Concept

When I saw an article on [Squib](https://andymeneely.github.io/squib/), a few very old ideas came up that I could see using the library for.  Figuring they might make good tests, I decided to spend a day brushing one or two of them off to see if Squib could cope with my imagination.

My final idea became a deck of cards that could be used for both a kind of war/combat game to capture card and a basic storytelling game.  I added the idea that each card would have two suits, as much a test for Squib as a possible way to make games more interesting.

And, because a project should be automated, it should be at least _possible_ to generate most of the deck programmatically.
